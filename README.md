# Division-Distances

Initial upload of code of minimizing distances.


To Do:
-Rewrite google api to be more modular, might be useful later on.
-Make number of divisions a paramter.
-Functionalize output
-Write proof to show minimum distance is actually said minimum. 
  -Probability based? Use kager min cut's proof.
